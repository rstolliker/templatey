# TypeScript with React template 

This template provides a minimal setup to use React with TypeScript.

TypeScript, Typings, and webpack are expected to be installed globally already. You must also install node and typings dependencies before this will work.

Almost completely the result of following the [TypeScript React & Webpack tutorial](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/react-&-webpack.html).
